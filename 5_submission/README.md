# Submission
This folder will contain all the submission files.  It is a good practice to keep all the submission files in a separate folder and review them before submitting. 

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_manuscript_file.pdf | This is the main pdf file for your submission. Copy and paste this from the 4_latex_source folder and review it before submitting to the journal. |
| 2_cover_letter.pdf    | A cover letter for your submission.                          |
| 3_metadata.md         | This file should contain all the supplementary text you need for the submission. See the sample file provided in this repository for detail. |

**Note: There are multiple other kinds of files that are required for submission but may vary as per the selected journal. See the journal's website for more details and include all of them in this folder.**

Every submission has two destinations:

- **Review:** If the reviewers like your paper, most likely, they will ask for a review. Once you incorporate all the reviews, you have to prepare a `rebuttal` outlining how you have answered all of their queries. The source files for the rebuttal are provided in the 4_latex_source/10_rebuttal folder.
- **Reject:** You have to find a different journal that would better suit your research and submit it there.
