# Submission
This folder will contain all the submission files.  It is a good practice to keep all the submission files in a separate folder and review them before submitting. 

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_manuscript_file.pdf | This is the main pdf file for your submission. Copy and paste this from the 4_latex_source folder and review it before submitting to the journal. |
| 2_cover_letter.pdf    | A cover letter for your submission.                          |
| 3_metadata.md         | This file should contain all the supplementary text you need for the submission. See the sample file provided in this repository for detail. |

**Note: There are multiple other kinds of files that are required for submission but may vary as per the selected journal. See the journal's website for more details and include all of them in this folder.**

# Submission checklist

1. All the figures and tables have a caption with inference.
2. All the figures and tables have been cited in the main text.
3. All the reviewers are cited in the manuscript.
4. The manuscript is spell-checked and grammar-checked.
5. Each highlight is less than 100 characters.
6. There is consistency in symbols, i.e. you have not used different symbols for the same entity.
7. All the symbols used, follow the nomenclature guidelines.
8. All the cross-references are correct.

Every submission has two destinations:

- **Review:** If the reviewers like your paper, most likely, they will ask for a review. Once you incorporate all the reviews, you have to prepare a `rebuttal` outlining how you have answered all of their queries. The source files for the rebuttal are provided in the 4_latex_source/10_rebuttal folder.
- **Reject:** You have to find a different journal that would better suit your research and submit it there.
