# project-template
This is a template repository for research projects. You can fork this repo and use it as a template to start a new research project.

# Rules
- Folder names should always be in small letters and should begin with a number.
- No spaces are allowed in folder or file names. You have to use the underscore "_".
- Numbering of the folders should be done in chronological order, i.e. the folders that come in the initial part of your research should have a smaller number.
- Every folder should have a readme file that should contain a description of the contents of that folder.

# Folder structure

The folders follow a 5-level wide and 3-level deep structure. That means it is preferable to have only five folders at a certain level, and the structuring of the information should be done in such a way that it is only 3-levels deep, starting from the top-level folder. This is necessary for the retrieval of the information at a later day.

| Name                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1_base_papers        | The papers that form the foundation for your research are kept in this folder.  We start a new project by curating a list of research publications in the area of interest. |
| 2_reference_codes    | The open-source codes relevant to your research that you find on the internet will be kept in this folder. In the field of computational mechanics, we try to find existing code implementations and study them to gain insight into the topic. |
| 3_our_implementation | This folder will have the source code for your research. This is your actual implementation that will lead to novel findings. |
| 4_latex_source       | Here we will have the latex source files. I highly recommend that you use latex to write your research. |
| 5_submission         | This folder will contain all the submission files.  It is a good practice to keep all the submission files in a separate folder and review them before submitting. |

**Note: See the readme file inside the folder for more details.**

# Submission checklist

1. All the figures and tables have a caption with inference.
2. All the figures and tables have been cited in the main text.
3. All the reviewers are cited in the manuscript.
4. The manuscript is spell-checked and grammar-checked.
5. Each highlight is less than 100 characters.
6. There is consistency in symbols, i.e. you have not used different symbols for the same entity.
7. All the symbols used, follow the nomenclature guidelines.
8. All the cross-references are correct.
